# Richter's Predictor: Modeling Earthquake Damage [[Link]](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/)

This repository shows the code of my submission to the machine learning competition "Richter's Predictor: Modeling Earthquake Damage". The goal is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal, based on aspects of building location and construction.

After implementing data preprocessing, conducting feature engineering, and fine-tuning hyperparameters, high performance models were successfully developed, including a Random Forest model and an XGBoost model.
